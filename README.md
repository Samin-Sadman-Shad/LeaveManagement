Developed a full-stack leave management portal using Clean (Onion) Architecture to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clear separation of concerns.

•	Built with ASP.NET Core Web API (backend) and ASP.NET Core MVC (client interface)

•	Implemented CQRS and Mediator pattern using MediatR, resulting in modular request handling, thin controllers, and easier unit testing.

•	Implemented JWT authentication with ASP.NET CORE Identity and JWT Bearer tokens for secure and stateless user authentication

•	Enabled employees to apply for leave and track status; admins to define leave types, allocate days, and manage approvals

•	Integrated FluentValidation for input validation and Entity Framework Core for data access

•	Used AutoMapper for mapping between DTOs and domain models

•	Wrote unit tests with Moq and Shouldly to ensure reliability
